</div>
		<div>Show me an
eelgrass meadow
</div>
		<div>They also trap dead leaves and roots.
</div>
		<div>Seagrass grows in meadows, in shallow coastal
waters all around the world.
It loves soft sandy sediments at the seafloor.
</div>
		<div>Scientists estimate that Danish seagrass meadows
store almost 6 million tons of carbon.
</div>
		<div>…the seafloor grows and carbon is trapped and buried...
</div>
		<div>…locking away carbon and offsetting sea level rise.
</div>
		<div>As the debris builds up...
</div>
		<div>This is not much compared to the country’s total
carbon footprint...
</div>
		<div>Seagrass traps particles
that contain carbon...
</div>
		<div>…as they fall to the seafloor.
</div>
		<div>…but encouraging seagrass meadows
to grow and expand,
means that more carbon could be taken up this way.
</div>
		<div>Where do you want to go now?
Use the buttons below to explore.
</div>
		<div>This is called a
"carbon sink"
</div>
		<div>Kelp</div>
		<div>Seagrass</div>
		<div>Scientists now know that these previously overlooked carbon sinks could be vast…
</div>
		<div>Extra text 2...
</div>
		<div>The carbon contained in the plant is buried and locked away at the seafloor.
</div>
		<div>Extra text...
</div>
		<div>...although they still don’t know the full distribution of kelp forests around the world...
</div>
		<div>…as ocean currents carry them far away, either as single plants or in great rafts.
</div>
		<div>When kelps die they float to the surface of the ocean.
</div>
		<div>Kelps and other large algae, called macroalgae,
grow on rocks and stones at the seabed..
</div>
		<div>Tiny air sacks along their leaves keep them afloat...
</div>
		<div>…and more research is needed to know exactly how much
carbon they take up, release, and store.
</div>
		<div>When the air sacks burst, the kelp sinks to the seabed, often in the deep ocean.
